##How to Use the Web Application
This is an employee portal web application that will typically be used as an intranet application in a company. It consists of 2 parts:
1. Front end: Employees can edit their profiles, view other's profiles searc for people and also view org chart for the company. Click on a position in the org chart to navigate up and down.

2. Back end: The HR administration, that adds, edits employees and positions. Typically in a company this would be a different application, but for the purposes of this project, it is included.


Opening the website:
log on as login:jdane password:halwa. Jenny is a part of HR as the Vice President of HR. She has access to the hr Page and can add and edit employees and positions.



The general procedure to add an employee is:
Add an employee, then create a position in a department and and the employee to the position.



Log on as a different employee (same password) and search for another one. Also update your profile and add a picture. You can also change your password.
The org structure is connected on position.


The schema can be viewed in the pdf schema.pdf


I'm not very savvy at web page design, which will be evident from some of the page layouts. The HR page needs to be redone for sure. I need to put in a navigation pane on the left. It will be a cleaner design both structurally and functionally.
